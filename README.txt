GRASPI stands for:
GRAnular Synthesizer on (raspberry? orange?) PI.

It is kind of a big project.
It all started out since I heard of the Collidoscope by Fiore Martin and Ben
Bengler. It's a crazy neat idea and I still can't believe few people are
interested in something like it.
My initial idea was to replicate their project, but it obviously evolved into
something different I'm still trying to define exactly.
Anyway, the GRASPI will be a PureData-based sampler/synthesizer (which is it?
I'm not really sure) running on a portable system, most likely a RaspberryPi or
an OrangePi (cheaper clone), equipped with an external sound card, a midi
controller, and probably a numeric keypad to access more features.
I will probably also find some use for the touchscreen I intend on equipping
the Pi with.
The project aims to stay under the 100$ range.

It will be divided in three stages:

1. Research
I will be researching, trying and experimenting with different Pure Data
patches, patterns and algorithms. This will be probably the longest part of the
project since as of now I really have no idea on how to work with Pure Data,
nor how to build a synthesizer. I just have some small clues builded up.

2. Software Development
After I'm done researching and finding the most fitting algorithms and patterns
I will develop the synthesizer patch(es) assembling all the right pieces in
the bigger picture. If stage 1 was done right this should come easier than
anybody would ever think.

3. Hardware Integration
When all the software will be ready it will be time to get the hands on the
hardware. Gathering all of it together, installing and configuring software,
it's probably not gonna be that much long, but it's gonna be a pain in the ass.
A lot of debugging, fixing and shaping up is gonna be needed but in the end
the result will be really interesting.

Let's also not forget that the strenght of software is that it's updatable.
Revisions, new features and modules will be added if the software meets
a discrete success.
