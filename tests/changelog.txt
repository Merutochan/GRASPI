First test file ever.
A prototype of Wave file recorder/player with save/open features from disk.
Added some sounds from findsounds.com

Started shaping the real project.
Created a player with a sawtooth (phasor) wave that plays back the file through
the tabread4~ object. There are volume, speed, lenght and starting point
controls. There is envelope control in two versions: graphical (not useful in
this project) and common ADSR which isn't really working since it's intended to
be implemented when I'll work on the Midi integration.

Re-arranged the project to keep it tidy.
Added a granular phasor that creates stairs in the original playback sawtooth.
Added a simple low pass and hi pass filter, not quite useful because of how
they're placed in the signal chain, and because of the lack of resonance.

Experimenting with VCF (voltage controlled filter), which didn't give the
results I was expecting. The controls aren't very intuitive and using a band
pass to obtain both low pass and high pass isn't the best idea. I'll find
another way to obtain a generic filter with low pass, hi pass and resonance
without wasting resources.
